/**
 * Constants for use in metadata annotations such as `@protected`.
 *
 * See also `@deprecated` and `@override` in the `dart:core` library.
 *
 * Annotations provide semantic information
 * that tools can use to provide a better user experience.
 * For example, an IDE might not autocomplete
 * the name of a function that's been marked `@deprecated`,
 * or it might display the function's name differently.
 *
 * For information on installing and importing this library, see the
 * [meta package on pub.dartlang.org]
 * (http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/meta).
 * For examples of using annotations, see
 * [Metadata](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch02.html#metadata)
 * in the language tour.
